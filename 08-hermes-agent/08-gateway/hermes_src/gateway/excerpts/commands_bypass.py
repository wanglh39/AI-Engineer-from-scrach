    Rationale: every gateway-registered slash command either has a
    specific Level-2 handler in gateway/run.py (/stop, /new, /model,
    /approve, etc.) or reaches the running-agent catch-all that returns
    a "busy — wait or /stop first" response. In both paths the command
    is dispatched, not queued.

    Queueing is always wrong for a recognized slash command because the
    safety net in gateway.run discards any command text that reaches
    the pending queue — which meant a mid-run /model (or /reasoning,
    /voice, /insights, /title, /resume, /retry, /undo, /compress,
    /usage, /reload-mcp, /sethome, /reset) would silently
    interrupt the agent AND get discarded, producing a zero-char
    response. See issue #5057 / PRs #6252, #10370, #4665.

    ACTIVE_SESSION_BYPASS_COMMANDS remains the subset of commands with
    explicit Level-2 handlers; the rest fall through to the catch-all.
