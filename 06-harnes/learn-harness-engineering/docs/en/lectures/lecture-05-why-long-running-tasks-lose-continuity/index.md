# Lecture 05. Keeping Context Alive Across Sessions

You ask Claude Code to implement a complete feature. It runs for 30 minutes, does most of the work, but context is running low. You start a new session to continue — and discover it doesn't remember what decisions were made last time, why option A was chosen over option B, which files were already modified, or what state the tests are in. It spends 15 minutes re-exploring the project, and might take an inconsistent approach from last time.

This is the real dilemma AI coding agents face in cross-session tasks. This lecture explains why agents "lose the thread" during long tasks, and how structured state persistence lets a new session quickly pick up where the last one left off.

## Context Windows: Not Infinite

Context windows are finite. This isn't a problem that model upgrades can solve — even if window sizes grow to 1M tokens, complex tasks will still exhaust them. Agents aren't just generating code; they're understanding codebases, tracking their own decision history, processing tool output, and maintaining conversation context. All this information grows faster than window expansion.

A deeper problem: the information agents produce isn't uniformly important. Intermediate reasoning steps contain the "why" of decisions — why option A was chosen over B, why this library instead of that one, why a particular optimization was skipped. The final output only contains the "what" — the code itself. Compaction strategies usually preserve the latter but lose the former. The next session sees the code but doesn't know why it's written that way, and might "optimize" away a deliberate design decision.

Anthropic observed something interesting in their long-running agent research: when agents sense context is running low, they exhibit a "rushed finish" behavior — rushing to finish current work, skipping verification steps, or choosing a simple solution over the optimal one. Anthropic calls this "context anxiety."

## Session Continuity Flow

Without state persistence files, every new session has to start from scratch:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S1["Session 1<br/>feature is half done"] --> End1["Context is nearly full<br/>session ends"]
    End1 --> S2["Session 2 starts fresh"]
    S2 --> Guess["Re-read folders, rerun tests,<br/>guess why the code was written this way"]
    Guess --> Drift["Work gets repeated<br/>and recovery is slow"]
```

With state persistence files, new sessions can pick up quickly:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Work["Session 1 work"] --> Progress["PROGRESS.md<br/>done / in progress / next step"]
    Work --> Decisions["DECISIONS.md<br/>why this approach was chosen"]
    Work --> Verify["Verification notes<br/>which tests pass and fail"]
    Work --> Commit["Git checkpoint<br/>exact repo state"]

    Progress --> Rebuild["Session 2 rebuild"]
    Decisions --> Rebuild
    Verify --> Rebuild
    Commit --> Rebuild

    Rebuild --> Resume["New session picks up quickly"]
```

## Core Concepts

- **Context windows are finite**: No matter what window size is claimed (128K, 200K, 1M), long tasks will eventually exhaust them. After exhaustion, either compaction (losing information) or reset (starting a new session) is required — both lose something.
- **State persistence files**: Persisted state files that let a new session unambiguously resume where the last one left off. The most basic form includes progress logs, verification records, and next actions.
- **Rebuild cost**: The time a new session needs to reach an executable state. A good harness can compress rebuild cost from 15 minutes to 3 minutes.
- **Drift**: The gap between the agent's understanding and the actual state of the code repository. Every session boundary introduces drift; without control, it compounds session after session.
- **Context anxiety**: A phenomenon observed by Anthropic — agents exhibit rushed finish behavior when approaching context limits, ending tasks early to avoid information loss. At its core, it's an irrational resource anxiety.
- **Compaction vs. reset**: Compaction summarizes context within the same session (keeps "what," may lose "why"); reset opens a new session rebuilding from persisted state (clean but depends on artifact completeness).

## What Happens When Continuity Breaks

The previous session spent significant context budget analyzing three approaches and choosing option B. This session's agent doesn't know about that analysis and might re-decide based on incomplete information — potentially choosing option A. Same information, different conclusion, because the decision-making context is gone.

Even worse is duplicate work. The agent isn't sure whether certain work was already completed and does it again. Or worse — does half of it, discovers a conflict with the existing implementation, and has to rework. Without progress records, the new session has no idea what's already been done.

Over several sessions, the implementation direction may have silently drifted from the original requirements. Each new session has a slightly different understanding of the project goals. Each deviation compounds on the last, and the final result may be far removed from the original intent.

There's also the verification gap. The previous session's verification results (which tests pass, which fail, why they fail) weren't recorded. The new session has to re-run all verification to understand the current state. Every session re-diagnoses from scratch, every time wasting precious context.

Both OpenAI and Anthropic emphasize structured state persistence in their documentation. OpenAI's harness engineering article treats the repository as an "operational record" — every operation's results should leave traceable evidence in the repo. Anthropic's long-running agents documentation specifically recommends "handoff files" — structured documents containing current state, known issues, and next actions.

## Practical Approaches to State Persistence

Core approach: **Treat the agent like an engineer whose short-term memory gets wiped at every session.** Before it "clocks out," it must write down critical information so the next "shift" agent can pick up quickly.

**Tool 1: Progress file (PROGRESS.md).** The most basic state persistence file:

```markdown
# Project Progress

## Current State
- Latest commit: abc1234 (feat: add user preferences endpoint)
- Test status: 42/43 passing (test_pagination_edge_case failing)
- Lint: passing

## Completed
- [x] User model and database migration
- [x] Basic CRUD endpoints
- [x] Auth middleware integration

## In Progress
- [ ] Pagination feature (90% - edge case test failing)

## Known Issues
- test_pagination_edge_case returns 500 on empty result sets
- Need to confirm whether deleted users should appear in listings

## Next Steps
1. Fix pagination edge case bug
2. Add "include deleted users" query parameter
3. Update API documentation
```

**Tool 2: Decision log (DECISIONS.md).** Record important design decisions and reasons. No need for detailed design documents — just "what decision, why, when":

```markdown
# Design Decisions

## 2024-01-15: Use Redis for user preferences caching
- Reason: High read frequency (every API call), small data size
- Rejected alternative: PostgreSQL materialized view (high change frequency makes maintenance cost not worthwhile)
- Constraint: Cache TTL of 5 minutes, active invalidation on write
```

**Tool 3: Git commits as checkpoints.** Commit after completing each atomic unit of work. Commit messages should explain what was done and why. These are free, automatically versioned state snapshots.

**Tool 4: init.sh or harness initialization flow.** Specify in `AGENTS.md` the "clock-in" and "clock-out" routines:

```markdown
## At session start (clock in)
1. Read PROGRESS.md for current state
2. Read DECISIONS.md for important decisions
3. Run make check to confirm repo is in consistent state
4. Continue from PROGRESS.md "Next Steps" section

## Before session end (clock out)
1. Update PROGRESS.md
2. Run make check to confirm consistent state
3. Commit all completed work
```

**Mixed strategy**: Not every task needs a context reset. Short tasks (under 30 minutes) can complete within one session. Long tasks (spanning sessions) must use progress files and decision logs for continuity. Decision criterion: if a task needs more than 60% of the window, start preparing the handoff.

### A Deeper Look at Context Anxiety

Anthropic's March 2026 research further revealed the specific manifestations of context anxiety: on Sonnet 4.5, when context approaches the window limit, the agent shows strong "rushed finish" behavior.

Two strategies address this:

**Compaction**: Summarizing early conversation within the same session. Advantage: maintains continuity, the agent can see "what." Disadvantage: "why" is often lost in summaries — why option B was chosen over A, why a particular optimization was skipped. More critically, compaction doesn't eliminate context anxiety — the agent knows context was once large, and psychologically still tends to rush to finish.

**Context reset**: Completely clearing context, opening a new session, rebuilding from persisted artifacts. Advantage: clean mental state — the new session has no "I'm running out of time" anxiety. Disadvantage: depends on the completeness of handoff artifacts. If the progress file is missing critical information, the new session may waste time going in the wrong direction.

Anthropic's actual data: for Sonnet 4.5, context anxiety is severe enough that compaction alone isn't sufficient — context reset becomes a critical component of harness design. But for Opus 4.5, this behavior is greatly diminished, and compaction can manage context without relying on resets. This means: **harness design needs specific understanding of the target model, not a one-size-fits-all template.**

## Real-World Example

An agent was tasked with implementing a blog system with user authentication — 12 feature points, estimated 5 sessions needed.

**Baseline without state persistence files**: Session 1 implemented the user model and basic routes. Session 2 started without the agent remembering the auth middleware's interface contract, spending ~15 minutes inferring the previous design intent. By session 3, accumulated drift caused the agent to start reimplementing already-completed features. By session 5, the repo contained lots of redundant code but the core auth feature still hadn't passed end-to-end tests. Only 7 of 12 feature points completed, 3 with hidden correctness issues.

**With state persistence files**: Using progress files, decision logs, verification records, and git checkpoints. State report updated automatically at each session end. Session 2's rebuild cost dropped to ~3 minutes. By session 5, all 12 feature points completed and verified.

Quantitative comparison: rebuild time reduced ~78%, feature completion rate from 58% to 100%, hidden defect rate from 43% down to 8%.

## Key Takeaways

- Context windows are a finite resource. Long tasks will span sessions, and sessions will lose information — this is objective reality.
- The solution isn't bigger windows — it's better state persistence. Progress files, decision logs, and git checkpoints work together to let new sessions pick up where previous ones left off.
- Treat the agent like an engineer whose short-term memory gets wiped every session: before "clocking out," write down what was done, why, and what's next.
- Rebuild cost is the key metric. A good harness should get new sessions to an executable state within 3 minutes.
- Mixed strategy: short tasks within sessions, long tasks with structured artifacts for continuity.

## Exercises

1. **State persistence measurement**: Pick a development task needing at least 3 sessions. Without providing any state persistence files, record at each session start how much context the agent spends "figuring out what happened last time." After each session, create a progress file and let the next session start from it. Compare rebuild costs with and without progress files.

2. **Handoff template design**: Design a minimal handoff template with four fields: repo state (commit hash), runtime state (test pass rate), blockers, next actions. Let a completely fresh agent session restore project state using only this template. Record ambiguities encountered during restoration, iterate to improve the template.

3. **Mixed strategy experiment**: In a 5-session development task, compare three strategies: (a) always start fresh sessions + progress files, (b) do as much as possible in one session (context compaction), (c) mixed strategy (short tasks in-session, long tasks across sessions + progress files). Compare rebuild time, feature completion rate, and decision consistency.
