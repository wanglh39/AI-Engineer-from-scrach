# English Reference

These notes explain how to use the templates as a working harness instead of a
loose pile of files.

## Internal Reference Notes

- [`method-map.md`](./method-map.md): map common long-running failure modes to
  the artifact or policy that addresses them first
- [`initializer-agent-playbook.md`](./initializer-agent-playbook.md): what the
  initializer should leave behind before feature work starts
- [`coding-agent-startup-flow.md`](./coding-agent-startup-flow.md): fixed
  session-start flow for later coding runs
- [`prompt-calibration.md`](./prompt-calibration.md): how to keep root
  instructions sharp without making them bloated and brittle

## Primary Articles

This list is intentionally narrow. A harness means the execution system around
the model: the agent loop, tool execution, sandboxing, state, context,
verification, termination, orchestration, and observability. General prompt
engineering or broad agent-framework articles do not belong in the primary
list.

The original three articles remain the backbone of the course:

- [OpenAI: Harness engineering: leveraging Codex in an agent-first world](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) (2026-02-11): agent-first repositories, repo-local context, custom linting, and structural guardrails.
- [Anthropic: Effective harnesses for long-running agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) (2025-11-26): initializer agent, coding agent, feature list, progress log, and handoff across context windows.

Only a few highly relevant 2026 articles are added:

## 2026 Extended References

These are not core course sources, but they are useful when designing specific
harness modules. This section only keeps sources whose body directly covers the
agent loop, tool execution, context management, verification, sandboxing,
control layers, or regression governance. Pure agent products, platform
announcements, team case studies, and benchmarks are excluded.

source for the course.
